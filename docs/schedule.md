# Schedule

The thesis and the project should be ready around the end of May.
In order to make sure lets say 05.14 (Sunday).

## Timeframe

Starting from 02.06 (Monday) this gives 14 weeks total. One way is
to divide this frame into 7 two week sprints.

## Resources

A reasonable resource amount is 10 hours a week, so 20 hours each sprint.
This totals at 140 hours.

## Schedule summary

* **S1** - 02.06-02.19 - Implement frame of the system, data handling
* **S2** - 02.20-03.05 - Implement normalization, representation, similarity measures
* **S3** - 03.06-03.19 - Use clustering algorithms, write about previous
* **S4** - 03.20-04.02 - Create test scenarios, examine first results
* **S5** - 04.03-04.16 - Raise new questions, scenarios, test them
* **S6** - 04.17-04.30 - Write about previous
* **S7** - 05.01-05.14 - Final touches and corrections

## Detailed summary
